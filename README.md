## 📝 Description

Welcome to Brainwave! A visually stunning, responsive landing page for an AI application featuring smooth animations, parallax effects, and modern design patterns like Bento Box layouts.

In an era where AI tools can quickly generate basic websites, I wanted to demonstrate skills that go beyond what automation can produce. The goal was to create a modern, eye-catching landing page for an AI application that would stand out from competitors' outdated designs.

The website showcases the application's features while providing a premium user experience through animations, responsive design, and visual appeal.

The project showcases advanced front-end development techniques that elevate it beyond what AI tools can generate, including custom animations, responsive layouts, and modern design patterns.

**Technologies Used:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Animation System** - Implemented parallax scrolling effects and custom animations using React libraries and CSS techniques. Created floating elements that react to user scrolling, enhancing the visual experience without compromising performance.

- **Responsive Bento Box Layout** - Designed and implemented a modern Bento Box layout for the services section, featuring different-sized cards that maintain visual hierarchy across all screen sizes. This approach showcases features effectively while creating visual interest.

- **Interactive Mobile Navigation** - Built a custom mobile navigation system with animated transitions, background elements, and scroll locking functionality. The menu features decorative elements like rings and sidelines that enhance the visual appeal.

- **Fully Responsive Design** - The website is fully responsive and looks great on all device sizes, from mobile to desktop.
